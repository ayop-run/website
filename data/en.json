No changing.\nWe rise while remaining.\nThe rat race dangles,\nbut it won't shape our angles.\n\nWe run the streets — city beats beneath our feet.\nWe run the track — rhythm over records, never looking back.\nWe run the trails — where the air grows thin and the spirit prevails.\n\nSome days fast, some days slow,\nstill we move, still we grow.\n\nStep by step, stride by stride,\nfreedom and joy are what we ride.\n\nTogether we run. Together we rise.\nNo one alone. No one denied.\n\nAYOP.\nAt Your Own Pace. Always."
